# GardenBuddy Application
You can't put a plant in the ground and expect it to grow.  It needs water and love and attention. There is great satisfacton when seeds sprout, plants grow, flowers bloom and dinner is havested from the back yard.  GardenBuddy offers our users advise, friendship and encouragement to grow myriad of flowers, vegetables, herbs and fruits regardless of whether they live in the heartland or the desert.  GardenBuddy offers advise and information so you know what will grow in your hardiness zone and the best time to plant.  Plus, we'll send you water reminders so your plants are never thirsty.
Happy Harvest!
